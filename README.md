#Ironwork Fitness README.md Document

##5 Planes of UX Design:

#*Aims of my website:

*Website: Ironworks Fitness

*User Goals: To gain knowledge about the gym and what it has to offer. They may wish to look into classes to attend, or contact 
the gym if they have any questions. They may potentially want to know what measures are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus.

*Site Owner Goals: The site owner will want the people that visit the website to want to sign up for a membership, by informing them about all the 
things the gym has to offer. 

##Strategy Plane:

###Focus:
1. Gallery
2. Contact Information
3. Map/ location of the gym
4. Information about the classes the gym offers
5. Sign Up Modal
6. Social Media links 
7. Social Distancing measures

The focuses listed above are essential for the website to contain as this is the information that a user will be looking for to decide wheather 
they want to become a member at the gym or not.

The target audience of the site will be 16+ as this is the age where gyms will allow you to lift actual weights at the gym. Content should be simplistic so that 
the older generation of visitors can navigate their way around the site relatively easy to find the information they need.

###Definition:
I am creating a website to inform the existing members about classes that the gym has to offer them, in case they want to change up their usual standard
gym workouts with something like indoor cycling with a group or yoga.

The site is also for potential members and aims to get them to sign up for a membership to recieve exclusive members benefits.

A clean and simple colour scheme will help to attract people to the aesthetic of the site.

###Value:
The value of this site to potential members is that they will understand the measures in place for covid-19, and find out what the gyms contact information is.
Information on the classes can also be found easily on the classes page, along with reviews. 

The gallery page will produce some photos to the users of the site to show them what the atmoshphere and comminity is like at the gym.
