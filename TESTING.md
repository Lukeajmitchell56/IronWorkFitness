# Testing.md file:

## This file will contain all of the problems I encounter whilst working on my milestone project. Each page will have it's assigned section for simplicity.

##  General Problems:

1. Problem: 'Active' class not being applied to classes.html when on the page. 

* Solution: Missed a space between 'active' and 'nav-item'.

2. Problem: Social links not leading to facebook, instagram etc. pages.

* Solution: Use of 'youtube.com' as opposed to 'https://www.youtube.com/'. Problem down to rushing. Also added target _blank to all footer socials.

3. Problem: Sign up modal when on mobile dropdown menu does not reveal modal when clicked. 

* Solution: Added "data-toggle="modal" data-target="#signUpModal"" after the classes. Now working.

## Index.html Problems: 

1. Problem: Can not get hero.jpg to display/ cover the jumbotron. 

* Solution: Used tutorial in course to help with the code needed. Lesson: "Updating Our Callout" Module: "User Centric Frontend Development"

2. Problem: Can not get the gallery section to appear next to the classes. 

* Solution: implemented the bootstrap grid system. 

3. Problem: 'See more' buttons for classes and gallery not leading to the pages. 

* Solution: Changed the button element to an anchor tag and styled like a button.

## Classes.html Problems:
