# Testing.md file:

## This file will contain all of the problems I encounter whilst working on my milestone project. Each page will have it's assigned section for simplicity.

## * General Problems:

1. Problem: 'Active' class not being applied to classes.html when on the page. 

* Solution: Missed a space between 'active' and 'nav-item'.

2. Problem: Social links not leading to facebook, instagram etc. pages.

* Solution: Use of 'youtube.com' as opposed to 'https://www.youtube.com/'. Problem down to rushing. Also added target _blank to all footer socials.

3. Problem: Sign up modal when on mobile dropdown menu does not reveal modal when clicked. 

* Solution: Added "data-toggle="modal" data-target="#signUpModal"" after the classes. Now working.
