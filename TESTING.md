# Testing.md file:

## This file will contain all of the problems I encounter whilst working on my milestone project. Each page will have it's assigned section for simplicity.

##  General Problems:

1. Problem: 'Active' class not being applied to classes.html when on the page. 

* Solution: Missed a space between 'active' and 'nav-item'.

2. Problem: Social links not leading to facebook, instagram etc. pages.

* Solution: Use of 'youtube.com' as opposed to 'https://www.youtube.com/'. Problem down to rushing. Also added target _blank to all footer socials.

3. Problem: Sign up modal when on mobile dropdown menu does not reveal modal when clicked. 

* Solution: Added "data-toggle="modal" data-target="#signUpModal"" after the classes. Now working.

## Index.html Problems: 

1. Problem: Can not get hero.jpg to display/ cover the jumbotron. 

* Solution: Used tutorial in course to help with the code needed. Lesson: "Updating Our Callout" Module: "User Centric Frontend Development"

2. Problem: Can not get the gallery section to appear next to the classes. 

* Solution: implemented the bootstrap grid system. 

3. Problem: 'See more' buttons for classes and gallery not leading to the pages. 

* Solution: Changed the button element to an anchor tag and styled like a button.

## Classes.html Problems:

1. Problem: Can not get the text for the classes information to move to the left of the div.

* Solution: Created 2 columns, one for the image and class name, and one for the paragraph about the class. Added a class and some padding to each paragraph
and seems to be working fine now.

2. Problem: Could not get part of div to move to the right of the rest of the content for the quotes. Found a piece of code to help fix it with position: right;.

* Solution: "position:absolute; right:0;" Source - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12710843/want-to-move-a-particular-div-to-right . Plus some other margins put in place 
by myself to make sure it looked good.

## Gallery.html Problems:

## Contact.html Problems:

1. Problem: map.png is not loading into page.

* Solution: used .jpg instead of .png as image name within code.
